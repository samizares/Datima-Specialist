I have uploaded an image in "public/assets/dental-xray-2.png". The image contains text(header), a call to action button and a background image. Use this image as reference to create a home page gallery styled like this  but i want the text and call to action to be html semantic elements rather than just an image file. I want my gallery to contain 4 slides of text and images i will provide you. The text and call to action button will be on the left of the slide and the image will act as the background but its graphics will be towards the right side of the slide. Use same text color and font you see on the reference image. To act as slider control, create 4 clickable reasonably sized red hollow circle at the bottom of the slides and let the current slide be filled with red color when in display. Make the slides show for 3 seconds before automatically moving to the next. Put a beautifully styled before and after arrow around the 4 rounded circle so the slides can be clicked manually to move to the next or previous slides. In slide 1, use the text "Complete Dental Package at Datima Specialist Clinics". Let the button text be "Book a Dentist Appointment" and use image in "public/assets/dental-xray.png".For slide 2,use image in "public/assets/paedatrics-care.png" and add text as "Expert Pediatrics Care at Datima Specialist Clinics" and the call to action text should be "Book Appointment Now". Slides 3 should use image in "public/assets/optometry-care.png" and the heading text will be "Experience Clearer Vision at Datima Specilist Clinics" and the call to action text should be "Book Appointment Now". Slide 4 should use image in "public/assets/lab-test.png" and the heading text should be "Professional Laboratory Services in our facility" and the call to action text should be "Book Appointment Now". Place this gallery under the navigational and let the width span the entire width of the web page
