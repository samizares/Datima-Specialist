I need to redesign Datima web app to follow the new folder structure i have created for this project. Create new folders matching the names of the static pages(About US, Our Services and Contact US) under the app folder. Extract the header and footer part of this application into the layout.tsx file. This involves moving the logo and nav items from the page.tsx to the layout.tsx. The slider you created should be the first component of the main page.tsx file. I want the static pages to have same header and footer in the layout.tsx file. Update the paths.ts with the new path of the pages,for example add "export const AboutUs =() => "/about-us"; for the about us page and do same for the remaining pages. Lastly, locate the image in "public/assets/hero-fuse2.png". This is a full width hero image. I want you to place this image in the hero section of each of the static pages(About Us, Our Services and Contact Us). On display, this hero image will appear under the header component from the layout.tsx. I want you to write code that will create breadcrumb texts to overlay the image. The texts should include a large heading of name of the page(e.g, About US, Our Services, and Contact Us).It should be boldly written and centered on the image and underneath the name of the page, a small font that display "Home > name of page"(like Home > About us).Make the Home text clickable and the href("/") leads to the home page. Don't modify the code in the header and the sliders section, just move to the right destination as described above.
